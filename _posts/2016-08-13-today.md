# direct connect is a peer to peer file sharing protocol

Direct Connect is a protocol for peer sharing files, that is to say, the files are stored not in a central place but in each user's system. All that the protocol does is help define the logistic rules for their transfer. 

There needs to be a central hub that acts as the moderator. It defines a place to which the peers connect with their share of files. Then there is the client software that hashes your files and makes them searchable and candidates for transfer as requested by anyone on the hub.

The process is surprisingly simple and takes no more than 300 seconds to get it up and running. The hub can be set up using [PtokaX](http://www.ptokax.org/), instruction there itself. Get [DC++](http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/) or [LinuxDC++](https://launchpad.net/linuxdcpp) as is necessary and start sharing. 

Set the hub on a Raspberry Pi and you are live 24x7
