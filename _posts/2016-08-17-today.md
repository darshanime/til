This mnemonic can be used to memorize the datatypes:

 - boolean - 8 bits (but JVM dependent) (default False)
 - char - 16 bits (default 0)
 - byte - 8 bits, 256 possible combinations, -128 to 127, (default 0)
 - short - 16 bits, (default 0)
 - int - 32 bits, (default 0)
 - long - 64 bits, (default 0)
 - float - 32 bits, (default 0.0)
 - double - 64 bits, (default 0.0)

 - Object reference variables - 64 bits/32 bits, (default null)


 Java is pass by value. When you pass an object, the object is copied, the address bits of the new object are assigned to the new reference variable and passed to the method. Changing the passed variable won't have an effect on the original variable. 

 In Python, it is pass by reference. But some objects are immutable (like strings) and hence, it behaves like pass by value for some datatypes.

 Encapsulation is good because it allows for data validation etc. Set the variables to private and let other classes access them by using getters and setters

 `for each` in java:

```java
int[] myarray = new int[10];
for (int element: myarray)
{
    System.out.println(element);
}
```

`ArrayList` can store variable number of values but they can't hold primitives directly, they need to be wrapped in a primitive wrapper
eg: 

```java
ArrayList<Dog> mydogs = new ArrayList<Dog>();
mydogs.add(new Dog());
mydogs.remove(0);
```


private methods cannot be inherited
