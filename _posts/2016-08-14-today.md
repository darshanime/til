# why is java cross platform

"I have had an on-off relationship with Java, using it during high school and much in college later.
Now, need to use it for development and I revisited the fundamentals"

Every Java program is just an interplay of objects of different classes. The JVM starts the program from the `main` method that must be present in any program.

{% highlight java %}
import java.util.*;

public class One
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("hello world!");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The source code is compiled to bytecode by the compiler. This bytecode is converted to machine code in the JVM. Since it runs in the JVM, the code is cross-platform. The JVM is just a specification, rules about how to convert bytecode to machine code.
