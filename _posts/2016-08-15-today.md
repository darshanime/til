# common syntax in java

 - new object:
   `Dog mydog = new Dog(name, size);`

 - lists in java: `int[] mylist = {1, 2, 3}`

 - typecasting in java: `int a = Integer.parseInt('8')`


access modifiers:

 - public - visible to add packages, the outside code can access it as well directly
 - protected - visible to all packages, can't be accessed directly from outside
 - no modifier - not visible outside own package, but not by subclasses in different packages
 - private - not visible to own package as well, only to self


loops:

 - while loop:
 `while (condition) { //code }`

 - if do - while
 `do 
 { //code }
 while (condiition);`

 - for
 `for (int a=0;a<100;a++)
 { //code }`

Variable once defined cannot be redefined because Java is a strongly typed language. 
`int a = 10;`
`int a = 15; // error`

Java is compiled - compiler converts to bytecode from source code which is then coverted to machine code in jvm. Python in interpreted, but here too, the code is converted to bytecode and run


In method definations you have to define the type of data to be returned. So:

```java
public void bark() 
{ 
    System.out.println("bow bow");
}
```

Sun's JVM is written in C, there is a JVM in python as well - PyJVM.
