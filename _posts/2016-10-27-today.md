# docker-compose can link containers 

Docker is a virtualization tool that abstracts the underlying hardware and operating system while also being amazing fast at the same time. Who says free lunch doesn't exist. It does exist, it comes along from the ingenuity and hard work of some smart men.

docker-compose is a tool to orchestrate many containers working together. So, if you wish to centralize your logs using the ELK stack say, you might go for one container per app. Then, docker-compose can be used to link them together. 

Example docker-compose.yml for the ELK stack:

```python
elasticsearch:
  image: elasticsearch:latest
  command: elasticsearch -Des.network.host=0.0.0.0
  ports:
    - "9200:9200"
    - "9300:9300"

logstash:
  build: logstash/
  command: logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf
  volumes:
    - ./logstash/config:/etc/logstash/conf.d
  ports:
    - "5000:5000"
  links:
    - elasticsearch
kibana:
  build: kibana/
  volumes:
    - ./kibana/config/:/opt/kibana/config/
  ports:
    - "5601:5601"
  links:
    - elasticsearch
```

Here, see how kibana is linked to elasticsearch. this is because kibana needs to connect to elasticsearch to query it's data  and not the other way round.
Similarly for logstash; it needs to connect to elasticsearch to send it data.
